A little project to learn C++

To prepare myself for UCLA's CS31 class, I decided to clone one of my favorite video games in the language which we will be studying. The master branch displays the game within an ncurses window and has been successfully tested on Linux and Windows 10. The "test" branch contains experimental code that displays the game on an RGB LED matrix using Henner Zeller's rpi-rgb-led matrix library.
